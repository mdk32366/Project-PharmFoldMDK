# PharmFoldMDK — Architecture

> **Living document.** This file is the single source of truth for how PharmFoldMDK
> is built and why. It MUST be updated **in the same change** that alters the
> architecture, and it MUST be brought current **before any PR is filed**. If a PR
> changes structure, data flow, dependencies, or deployment and does not touch this
> file, the PR is incomplete. See [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) for the
> chronological log of individual design decisions.

**Project**: PharmFoldMDK — an Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) target exploration platform.
**Context**: Graded coursework for a **Deep Learning** class in an ML Master's program.
**Status (2026-07-19)**: Pre-implementation. Planning docs are in `docs/`; no application code yet.

## 1. Prime Directive: Deep Learning Is the Core, Not a Wrapper

This is a **deep learning course project**. The grade depends on deep learning doing
**load-bearing work** — a neural network must be responsible for a primary output, not
merely calling an external service that happens to use ML internally.

Every architectural decision is evaluated against the question: **"Where is the deep
learning, and is *our* system running/using it in a defensible way?"**

- ✅ Running a protein language model (e.g. ESMFold) to fold sequences into 3D structure.
- ✅ A learned model that scores druggability / pocket suitability from structural features.
- ✅ Learned embeddings (from a neural encoder) powering semantic search over analyses.
- ✅ A model predicting mutation impact (ΔΔG / binding-site disruption).
- ⚠️ Pure retrieval from AlphaFold DB or UniProt lookups — acceptable as a *fallback or
  input*, but it cannot be the graded deliverable on its own.

**Rule:** at least one iteration's headline feature must be a deep-learning model that
this project runs or fine-tunes. This is recorded and defended in `docs/README.md`.

## 2. System Overview

PharmFoldMDK lets a user enter a cancer type or an overexpressed protein and returns
AI-driven structural analysis of that protein as a potential ADC target: predicted 3D
structure with confidence, druggable pockets, an ADC-suitability assessment, mutation
impact, and pharma-relevant reports.

**Boundary rule:** the database stores structured data, JSONB metadata, vectors, and the
**job queue**; **large binary artifacts (PDB/mmCIF, PAE JSON, generated reports, uploads)
live on the Fly Volume**, with only their paths recorded in Postgres.

**Topology rule (D-004):** deep-learning inference does **not** run on Fly. The Fly serving
tier is GPU-free and always on; a **local GPU worker** pulls jobs from Fly, runs ESMFold,
and uploads results back over an authenticated outbound connection. No inbound port is
opened on the local machine.

---

## 3. Component Architecture

| Layer | Responsibility | Planned tech |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **Frontend** | Interactive UI, 3D visualization, onboarding | Streamlit; `py3Dmol`/`stmol` for 3D |
| **Backend API** | Auth, request handling, **job queue** management, results | FastAPI + Uvicorn (on Fly) |
| **Local GPU worker** | Polls Fly for jobs, runs **ESMFold** on the local NVIDIA GPU, uploads artifacts back (D-004) — **not deployed to Fly** | Python worker; PyTorch + Hugging Face (`facebook/esmfold_v1`) |
| **DL / Inference core** | The neural work: **ESMFold structure prediction (D-003)**, plus pocket/druggability scoring, embeddings, mutation impact | PyTorch + Hugging Face; `biopython` for parsing |
| **Data layer** | Persistence, relationships, vector search | Postgres + pgvector, SQLModel/SQLAlchemy, Alembic |
| **Object storage** | Large structure/report files | Fly Volume mounted at `/data`, organized `/data/analyses/{id}/` |

> **Ratified (D-003 + D-004):** we **run ESMFold ourselves** — the ESM-2 protein language
> model + folding head predicting 3D structure from a single sequence, emitting pLDDT and
> PAE — **on a local GPU worker, not on Fly** (see §5). AlphaFold DB / UniProt retrieval is
> demoted to an optional fast path + fallback, not the deliverable.

---

## 4. Data Model (from Database Plan v2)

Primary entities (full column detail in [`docs/Database_Plan_v2_Postgres.md`](docs/Database_Plan_v2_Postgres.md)):

- **`users`** — auth (username + hashed password), JSONB `preferences`.
- **`protein_analyses`** — core entity: input type/value, structure source, `pdb_path`,
  `mean_plddt`, `pae_json_path`, JSONB `metadata`, notes. ADC-specific fields
  (e.g. `adc_suitability_score`) to be added as extensions.
- **`mutations`** — 1:N from an analysis; position, original/new AA, impact score + notes.
- **`reports`** — 1:N from an analysis; report type, `content_path`, timestamps.
- **`analysis_embeddings`** — `vector(384)` with an HNSW cosine index for semantic search
  (Iteration 3+).
- **`jobs`** (D-009 §1) — **transient** fold-queue state, kept **separate** from the durable
  `protein_analyses` record: `analysis_id` FK, `status`
  (`pending`/`claimed`/`complete`/`failed`), `claimed_at`, `worker_id`, `attempts`, `error`,
  and `inference_settings` JSONB (dtype / `chunk_size` / model revision — the reproducibility
  record). Claimed via `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; stale `claimed` jobs (>30 min) are
  requeued. This is the durable queue the local GPU worker (D-004) pulls from.

**Relationships:** `users` 1:N `protein_analyses` 1:N (`mutations`, `reports`, `jobs`).
**Migrations:** Alembic, versioned. Any schema change ships with a migration.

## 5. Storage, Deployment & Inference Topology

### Two-tier topology (D-004)

- **Serving tier — Fly.io (always-on, no GPU):** Streamlit + FastAPI, Postgres + pgvector,
  Fly Volume. Hosts the app, the data, and the **job queue**.
- **Inference tier — local machine (NVIDIA GPU, 8 GB VRAM):** a **`worker/`** process that
  **pulls** pending jobs from Fly over an authenticated **outbound** connection, runs
  ESMFold on the local GPU, uploads PDB/pLDDT/PAE back, and marks the job done/error. **Not
  deployed to Fly.** No inbound exposure of the local machine; jobs queue when it is offline.

### Fly serving-tier specifics

- **Database:** Fly Postgres addon with pgvector (`CREATE EXTENSION vector;`).
- **Files:** Fly Volume at `/data`; DB holds paths only.
- **Backups:** Fly Postgres automated backups + volume snapshots.
- **Migrations:** Alembic versioned scripts, applied on deploy.

### Deploy gate (D-005 → proven & hardened in D-008) — no untested code to prod

- **GitHub Actions:** PRs and pushes to `main` run a `test` job; the **Fly deploy job runs
  only if tests pass** (`deploy: needs: [test]`). Needs `FLY_API_TOKEN` in Actions secrets.
- **Branch protection on `main` is the actual enforcement (D-008):** require a PR, require
  the **`test`** check, **`enforce_admins: true`** (no bypass, owner included), no direct
  pushes. Without it the gate is advisory — a failing check does not block a merge, and
  `git push origin main` walks straight past it.
- **No `paths-ignore` (D-008):** since `test` is a *required* check, it must report on every
  PR or a doc-only PR hangs unmergeable; the ~20s suite therefore runs on everything. When
  real deploy is wired, guard the **deploy job** (not the trigger) against doc-only changes.

### ⚠ VRAM constraint (8 GB) — fold path is UNRESOLVED (D-006 invalidated by S-001)

**Measured 2026-07-19 (S-001):** the fp16 model is resident at **8116 MiB** against **7043 MiB
free / 8151 MiB physical** — it spills to shared system RAM *before any fold*. **fp16 alone does
not fit `esmfold_v1` in 8 GB.** The D-006 ladder (fp16 → chunking → cap → ECD → caching) is
**invalid at rung one**: rungs 2+ reduce *activation* memory and cannot fix a *resident-weight*
overrun. Weights are **9.58 GB on disk** (not ~2.5 GB). Warm-cache load is **15–16 s**.

**The local GPU tier is BLOCKED ON HARDWARE (S-002 Q1, 2026-07-19).** Three 630 aa attempts each
ended in an identical host bugcheck (`0x00020001`). Windows event logs (**not** the minidumps —
unreadable without admin) identify the component: **PCIe Advanced Error Reporting faults on the
inference GPU itself** (`PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_2D39` = RTX PRO 2000 Blackwell), with 3 fatal WHEA
errors matching the 3 crashes 1:1 and **no** display-driver TDR. VBS/HVCI is running, which is why
a fatal hardware error surfaces as HYPERVISOR_ERROR.

**Latent fault, workload-triggered — neither "unrelated bad hardware" nor "we broke it."**
Corrected AER errors on this exact device predate the project (148 across 7 days since
2026-05-27, on days with no ESMFold), and a May 27 fatal proves the link can go fatal without us.
But the `0x00020001` signature has **zero** occurrences before today. One fatal in eight weeks vs
**three in twenty minutes** ≈ four orders of magnitude — the workload is an **accelerant**.

**Mechanism (connects to the spill finding rather than competing with it):** the fp16 overrun is
serviced by shuttling memory across the PCIe bus, and sustained heavy PCIe traffic is exactly what
turns corrected link errors into uncorrected ones. **Testable prediction: a configuration that
fits in VRAM should crash far less, or not at all.** So the tier is **conditional, not dead** —
the resident-footprint fix is the candidate remedy, and must be measured (S-002 Q1) before writing
the local tier off.

**Consequence:** cache generation *may* move to **different compute** (cloud GPU / Colab / cluster)
to de-risk the schedule — a ≥16 GB GPU also makes the fp16 non-fit stop binding — but that is
de-risking, **not** a verdict against the local tier. Inside the D-004 §5 boundary either way, and
**not** a retreat to retrieval.

**Replacement rung one is now MEASURED (S-003, 2026-07-19): quantize the ESM-2 LM trunk to int8
(`bitsandbytes`), folding head at full precision.** On the Trop-2 ECD (248 aa): resident
**5351 MiB**, peak **5779 MiB** — comfortably under both the 7799 MiB target and the 7043 MiB
actually free — **no spill**, and ~1.8× faster than fp16. Mean pLDDT 74.7 vs the 70.7 fp16 baseline —
**verified reproducible** (two folds: pLDDT delta 0.000, CA-RMSD 0.0000 Å, so the shift is a real
precision effect, not variance) and **verified non-degenerate** (248/248 CA atoms, zero NaN coords,
Rg 18.74 Å against a 17.9 Å compact-globular expectation). *Accuracy is still unproven: pLDDT is
self-confidence, so a cross-precision TM-score/RMSD comparison remains the outstanding follow-up.* **bf16 is rung two**
— same footprint as fp16 so it cannot fix the fit, but it costs nothing and holds quality (+0.2).
CPU-offload is **excluded by design**: it trades VRAM for the PCIe traffic implicated in the link
fault. Per D-004 §5 this stays inside "smaller model / narrower targets" and explicitly **does not**
mean retreating to AlphaFold retrieval.

**Still unconfirmed:** whether a non-spilling configuration stops the host crashes — that is
S-002 Q1, now testable against a config that genuinely fits.

> **Open decision (log in `docs/README.md`):** **prod** DB — SQLite-on-Volume prototype
> (Database Plan §5) vs. Postgres-first. pgvector is central to the DL semantic-search
> story, so Postgres-first is the current lean. *(The **test** DB is SQLite regardless —
> D-005.)*

## 6. Iteration Roadmap (DL mapped)

| Iter | Product goal | Deep-learning content |
|------|--------------|-----------------------|
| **1 (MVP)** | **Cache-first (D-009 §3)**: Mission Briefing + curated ADC target DB served from pre-folded cached artifacts; live user folding deferred. **Two caps, not one (D-009 §3 amendment):** the **cache-build cap** is bounded by *memory fit + host stability only* — wall time is **not** a criterion, so `chunk 16/8` and multi-minute folds are acceptable; the **interactive cap** (Iteration 1.5+) is latency-bounded (`chunk ≥32`, `<120 s`). This is what makes large ECDs such as **HER2 (630 aa)** reachable for the cache even if never viable interactively | **ESMFold run in-project (D-003)** — the pipeline that *produces* the cache must be real, committed, reproducible code (binding condition of D-009 §3) |
| **2** | Mutation simulator, comparison views, pocket scoring | Learned mutation-impact and/or druggability model; ESMFold folds wild-type vs. mutant for comparison |
| **3** | Reports, semantic library search | Neural embeddings + pgvector semantic search; report synthesis |
| **4 (stretch)** | Epitope suggestion, ADC complex modeling, agentic workflows | Advanced/agentic DL |

---

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Security (MVP):** username + hashed password (bcrypt/passlib); protected API routes.
- **Confidence honesty:** pLDDT/PAE surfaced clearly; outputs framed with caveats.
- **Testing (D-005):** all tests live in **`tests/`**. Two kinds — **functional** (`pytest`,
  `*.py`: data layer, inference logic, API, worker contract) and **user-based** (structured
  human scenarios) — see [`docs/Test_Plan.md`](docs/Test_Plan.md). The **test DB is SQLite**
  (in-memory/temp); external calls and ESMFold inference are **mocked** for speed/determinism.
  **Gap:** SQLite can't exercise pgvector/Postgres-specific paths — those are mocked now and
  get a separate Postgres integration job at Iteration 3.
- **Reproducibility (course expectation):** pin model weights/versions, seed where
  relevant, and record any training/fine-tuning config so results can be reproduced.

## 8. Repository Layout (target)

Today the repo holds the governance files, `docs/`, and the **keel** (D-007): `tests/`
(in-memory SQLite fixture + smoke test) and `.github/workflows/gate.yml` (test → deploy
gate). The rest — `app/`, `core/`, `worker/`, `db/`, `Dockerfile` — is created as iterations
land, and this layout section is updated when it changes.

---

## 9. Governance (how this doc stays true)

1. **Every PR that changes architecture updates this file in the same PR.** No exceptions.
2. **Every design decision is written into [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) *before*
   the work it describes is finished** — the decision log leads the code, not the reverse.
3. When a decision in the log changes the system's shape, fold the outcome into the
   relevant section here so this document never drifts from reality.
